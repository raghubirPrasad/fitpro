ABSTRACT

FitPro is a Java Swing–based health and wellness application that helps users consistently track daily behaviors and sustain long‑term goals. It addresses the common problem of fragmented, manual self‑tracking—which undermines motivation and adherence—by centralizing progress across fitness, nutrition, habits, and mindfulness, and by providing instant, visual feedback. Users create a profile (age, height, weight) and set personal targets; day‑to‑day workflows include logging steps and workouts with MET‑based calorie estimation, recording meals and water intake, toggling habit completion, and capturing meditation time and mood. Built‑in calculators compute BMI, BMR, and TDEE, translating activity level into practical daily calorie targets. An animated dashboard aggregates progress toward goals, while a profile panel surfaces calculated metrics and enables quick target adjustments. Robust input validation with typed exceptions ensures clean data entry, and a lightweight in‑memory store organizes session data per user. Together, these features reduce tracking friction, automate key calculations, and turn small daily actions into clear, motivating progress.

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

Background
Health and wellness tracking has shifted from isolated tools toward integrated, user‑centric experiences that unify activity, nutrition, habit formation, and mental wellbeing. While many solutions focus on single domains (e.g., only workouts or only calorie counting), everyday decision‑making spans multiple behaviors. Fragmented tracking increases cognitive load, reduces adherence, and makes progress hard to see. FitPro addresses this by centralizing daily data—steps and workouts with MET‑based energy estimates, meals and water intake, habit completion, and mindfulness (meditation time and mood)—into one cohesive desktop application with immediate, animated feedback and practical calculators (BMI, BMR, TDEE). The system’s Java Swing foundation favors simplicity, offline access, and cross‑platform availability, enabling consistent use without accounts or network dependencies.

Motivation
The project is motivated by the need to reduce friction in self‑monitoring and turn small actions into visible, motivating progress. FitPro lowers the burden of tracking through clear forms, strict validation, and real‑time visualizations, helping users sustain adherence. It promotes a holistic view of wellness by linking physical activity and nutrition to habits and mindfulness, recognizing that mood and routine strongly influence consistency. TDEE integration converts activity level into a daily calorie target, guiding practical meal planning. Animated dashboards and incremental counters reinforce self‑efficacy, while lightweight, in‑memory storage supports quick iteration and privacy. Together, these choices make the application accessible, engaging, and effective for beginners and experienced users seeking structured, day‑to‑day guidance across fitness, meals, habits, and mindfulness.

OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE

Objectives
- Provide a user‑friendly desktop app to create a profile (age, gender, height, weight) and manage targets across fitness, meals, and mindfulness.
- Integrate daily tracking: steps and workouts (MET‑based), sports/running inputs, meals and water intake, habit completion, and meditation time/mood.
- Deliver immediate calculations: BMI, BMR, and TDEE; use TDEE to set daily calorie targets in meals.
- Offer animated, at‑a‑glance feedback via the dashboard and panel counters to sustain motivation.
- Enforce clean, reliable data entry through strict validation and typed exceptions.
- Keep the experience simple, offline, and fast with in‑memory, per‑user session storage.

Scope (Current)
- Platform: Java Swing desktop application with `LoginFrame`, `MainFrame`, and panels for Dashboard, Fitness, Meals, Habits, Mindfulness, Calculators, and Profile.
- Profile: Create user with essential details; view metrics; edit targets (steps, calories burned/eaten, water, meditation time).
- Fitness: Add steps; track workouts via MET tables; support sports and running (time, distance, speed); manual activity entry; activities list with removal; target configuration.
- Meals: Select items from categorized static data; manual items (Misc) and water intake; total calories display; update targets; meals list with removal.
- Habits: Add, toggle, and remove habits; display completion progress; reset via New Day.
- Mindfulness: Log meditation minutes; set target; select mood and display current status.
- Calculators: Compute BMI, BMR, TDEE; TDEE feeds daily calorie target in meals.
- Dashboard: Aggregate and animate key metrics with progress bars; supports New Day reset across all trackers.
- Validation & Storage: Strict input validation with typed exceptions; singleton in‑memory storage per user; data persists only during the session (no external DB, no network services).
- Constraints: Manual data entry; single‑session persistence; no historical analytics/graphs, recipe suggestions, or external API integrations in the current scope.

CONCLUSION
FitPro brings physical and mental wellbeing together in one cohesive, desktop application. By unifying daily fitness activities (steps, workouts, sports/running), meal logging and water intake, habit formation, and mindfulness (meditation time and mood), the app reduces tracking friction and translates small actions into visible progress. Built‑in calculators (BMI, BMR, TDEE) convert personal data and activity level into practical guidance, while an animated dashboard provides immediate, motivating feedback across all goals.

The system’s design emphasizes reliability and simplicity: strict input validation with typed exceptions protects data quality; predictable panel contracts streamline interaction; and lightweight, per‑user in‑memory storage keeps usage fast and private. Targets are editable and connected end‑to‑end—for example, TDEE informs meal calorie goals—so users can adjust plans and see the impact the same day. Within its current, offline scope, FitPro functions as an all‑in‑one platform for rounded wellbeing, helping individuals build consistency across movement, nutrition, routines, and mindfulness.

FUTURE SCOPE
- Integrate automatic data capture via wearables and phone sensors (steps, heart rate, GPS) using platforms like Google Fit/Apple Health to reduce manual entry and enrich cardio metrics.
- Persist data beyond sessions by introducing local storage (e.g., SQLite) and secure cloud sync with user authentication for multi‑device continuity and history backup.
- Add time‑series history and analytics: weekly/monthly trends, adherence scores, streak tracking, goal forecasts, and proactive alerts when falling behind or exceeding targets.
- Expand nutrition with a searchable food database, macro breakdown (carbs, proteins, fats), barcode scanning, and simple, goal‑aligned meal plans powered by TDEE.
- Introduce social and community features: challenges, leaderboards, friend groups, and shared goals with privacy controls to sustain long‑term motivation.
- Provide trainer/coach roles: controlled data sharing, remote plan suggestions, progress monitoring, and feedback loops integrated into Fitness and Meals workflows.
- Deepen mindfulness: guided sessions, mood journaling, correlations across mood ↔ activity/meals/habits, breathing exercises, and optional HRV‑based stress insights.
- Improve UI/UX: themes (light/dark), accessibility (keyboard navigation, high contrast), localization, onboarding tips, and consistent, scalable component patterns.
- Evolve architecture: introduce layered services and repository interfaces, dependency injection, background jobs for sync/notifications, and a plugin system for third‑party integrations.
- Expose APIs and notifications: REST/WebSocket endpoints for companion mobile/web clients, desktop notifications for reminders, and secure data export/import.
- Strengthen quality and security: comprehensive tests (unit/integration/UI), error logging and telemetry, encryption in transit/at rest, and privacy‑first settings.

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
Functional Requirements
- User Management: Users register and log in; the application stores username, password, name, age, gender, height, and weight, and allows editing daily targets through the Profile panel; all data is scoped to the current user session.
- Dashboard: The dashboard aggregates and animates steps, calories burned and eaten, water intake, habits completed, and meditation time, displays progress bars for each goal, and supports a New Day reset across trackers.
- Meals Tracking: Users add meals from categorized static data or manual Misc entries, track daily water intake, set and update target calories and water, remove entries from the list, and view calorie and water totals in real time.
- Fitness Tracking: Users add steps, calculate calories using MET tables, track sports and running with time, distance, and speed, enter manual activities, configure target steps and target calories, manage an activities list, and perform a New Day reset.
- Habit Tracking: Users add, toggle, and remove habits, view completion progress for the day, and reset habits for a new day.
- Mindfulness: Users log meditation minutes, set a meditation target, select mood, and view the current mindfulness status.
- Health Calculators: The application computes BMI and BMR and sets TDEE based on activity level, using TDEE to guide daily meal calorie targets in the Meals panel.
- Validation and Exceptions: All inputs are parsed and validated, with typed exceptions surfaced for invalid, negative, decimal, special‑character, numeric, or zero‑value errors.
- Persistence: Data is maintained in memory per user via a singleton handler, persists only during the session, and does not use external databases or network services.
- GUI and Navigation: The application provides `LoginFrame` and `MainFrame` with panels for Dashboard, Fitness, Meals, Habits, Mindfulness, Calculators, and Profile, supports logout, shows context‑aware fields (e.g., activity inputs), and provides animated success feedback.
- Panel Data Refresh: When switching back to a panel, its data reloads from the in‑memory store to keep displays consistent across views.

Non‑Functional Requirements
- Usability: The application provides intuitive navigation and clear forms, surfaces at‑a‑glance metrics, and delivers immediate animated feedback to reinforce progress.
- Reliability: Strict validation ensures clean data entry, predictable panel contracts control state transitions, and offline operation avoids dependence on network services.
- Performance: Lightweight in‑memory operations minimize latency, animations remain smooth, and updates across panels and the dashboard are responsive.
- Maintainability: Modular packages (`models`, `utils`, `gui`, `main`), abstract bases (`BasePanel`, `TrackingData`), and reusable utilities (`Validator`, `Calculator`, `AnimatedButton`) promote clear separation of concerns.
- Security & Privacy: The app does not transmit data externally; storage is session‑only; and user credentials remain in memory during runtime.
- Scalability: The design supports multiple users within a session and allows extensions for new trackers, data categories, and integrations.
- Portability: As a Java Swing desktop application, the app runs cross‑platform without network dependencies.
- Offline‑first: All core workflows operate fully offline with session‑scoped storage.
- Feedback & Consistency: Consistent interaction patterns and visual feedback improve engagement and reduce cognitive load across panels.

IMPLEMENTATION

Exceptions
`InvalidInputException.java` defines a user-defined checked exception carrying a custom message (`InvalidInputException extends Exception` in `src/wellnessapp/exceptions/InvalidInputException.java:7-19`). It centralizes invalid input reporting from validators and UI handlers so panels can surface actionable messages to users; for example, multi-catch blocks reference it in `FitnessPanel` and `MealPanel` to handle parse failures (`src/wellnessapp/gui/FitnessPanel.java:520`, `src/wellnessapp/gui/MealPanel.java:493`). `NegativeValueException.java`, `DecimalValueException.java`, `NumericValueException.java`, `SpecialCharacterException.java`, and `ZeroValueException.java` follow the same pattern (each stores a message, calls `super(message)`, and overrides `getMessage`) to represent precise input violations (`src/wellnessapp/exceptions/*:7-19`). They are thrown by `Validator` methods and caught across the GUI—for example, name and text validations in `LoginFrame` (`src/wellnessapp/gui/LoginFrame.java:243-262`), meal item additions in `MealPanel` (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MealPanel.java:493`), habit creation in `HabitPanel` (`src/wellnessapp/gui/HabitPanel.java:149`), meditation time updates in `MindfulnessPanel` (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MindfulnessPanel.java:191`), and BMI/BMR calculations in `CalculatorPanel` (`src/wellnessapp/gui/CalculatorPanel.java:241, 267`). This typed-exception approach makes the validation layer explicit and keeps messages consistent across forms.

GUI
`BasePanel.java` is an abstract foundation for all panels, capturing shared state (`user`, a singleton `FileHandler`) and a fade-in animation via a Swing `Timer` and `AlphaComposite` (`src/wellnessapp/gui/BasePanel.java:20-38`, `44-70`). It declares abstract hooks `loadData()` and `updateDisplay()` to enforce panel contracts, and is extended by Dashboard, Fitness, Meals, Habits, Mindfulness, Calculators, and Profile.

`MainFrame.java` hosts the application shell: it instantiates every panel, renders a navigation bar with `AnimatedButton`s, and swaps the center content using a simple `showPanel` helper (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MainFrame.java:24-41`, `65-80`, `143-151`). Its constructor sets frame metadata (`setTitle`, `setSize`, `setDefaultCloseOperation`, `setLocationRelativeTo`) (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MainFrame.java:25-29`), wires action listeners to refresh and display panels (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MainFrame.java:81-135`), and defaults to the Dashboard (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MainFrame.java:139-141`). It depends on all other GUI classes and the `AnimatedButton` utility for visual feedback.

`LoginFrame.java` implements authentication UI with fields and actions to login or create a new user (`src/wellnessapp/gui/LoginFrame.java:31-40`, `76-90`). It retrieves the in-memory users map from `FileHandler` (`src/wellnessapp/gui/LoginFrame.java:32-34`), validates credentials, and on success disposes the window and launches `MainFrame` (`src/wellnessapp/gui/LoginFrame.java:92-111`, `106-108`). The embedded `CreateUserDialog` collects profile data, invokes `Validator` for typed checks, and surfaces exceptions through Swing dialogs (`src/wellnessapp/gui/LoginFrame.java:127-219`, `243-262`).

`Dashboard.java` presents an animated overview of daily progress, with labeled metrics and color-coded progress bars for steps, calories burned/eaten, water, habit completion, and meditation time (`src/wellnessapp/gui/Dashboard.java:20-33`, `542-558`). It loads current targets, runs a `Timer` to interpolate values toward targets, updates labels with formatted text, and applies color thresholds to progress bars (`src/wellnessapp/gui/Dashboard.java:460-540`, `542-581`). The panel reads per-user data from `FileHandler` and is shown first from `MainFrame`.

`MealPanel.java` manages meal logging and water intake with category and item selectors backed by a static `MealsData` catalog, plus a Misc path for manual entries (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MealPanel.java:134-162`, `165-213`). It shows serving size and calories, enables “Add to Total”, and updates targets for meal calories and water (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MealPanel.java:214-235`, `236-240`, `528-541`). The panel validates inputs with `Validator`, handles typed exceptions via multi-catch, persists session changes with `FileHandler`, and animates number changes and success feedback (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MealPanel.java:535-541`, `554-570`, `572-617`).

`FitnessPanel.java` captures steps and activity energy expenditure using curated MET tables for workouts and sports; it dynamically shows context fields (reps, time, distance, speed, manual calories) based on selection (`src/wellnessapp/gui/FitnessPanel.java:55-79`, `81-107`, `445-503`). The panel computes calories from weight and activity specifics, builds labeled entries, updates the activities list, and tracks daily targets for steps and calories (`src/wellnessapp/gui/FitnessPanel.java:546-599`, `149-160`, `166-181`). Input parsing leverages `Validator`, with strict exceptions surfaced in dialogs, and session storage is maintained via `FileHandler`.

`HabitPanel.java` lets users add, toggle, and remove habits, computes daily completion counts, and animates feedback on changes (`src/wellnessapp/gui/HabitPanel.java:72-80`, `103-124`, `185-202`). It binds to a `HabitTracker` model from storage (`loadData`) and rebuilds the list whenever state changes (`src/wellnessapp/gui/HabitPanel.java:248`, `204-209`). Validation prevents invalid names, and exceptions are displayed through Swing dialogs (`src/wellnessapp/gui/HabitPanel.java:126-153`).

`MindfulnessPanel.java` records meditation minutes, sets targets, tracks mood via a dropdown, and displays current status (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MindfulnessPanel.java:64-78`, `84-101`, `107-123`, `129-137`). It saves changes with `FileHandler`, enforces positive integer inputs with `Validator`, and provides subtle animations on success (`src/wellnessapp/gui/MindfulnessPanel.java:172-191`, `197-216`, `218-220`).

`CalculatorPanel.java` implements BMI, BMR, and TDEE workflows, pre-populating fields from the user profile and animating metric displays (`src/wellnessapp/gui/CalculatorPanel.java:78-112`, `117-163`, `165-187`). It calls static methods in `Calculator`, validates inputs with `Validator`, and sets daily calorie targets via activity-level buttons (Sedentary/Moderate/Active) (`src/wellnessapp/gui/CalculatorPanel.java:191-220`, `207-220`).

`ProfilePanel.java` centralizes profile display and target editing, computing and formatting BMI, BMR, and TDEE in-place for context (`src/wellnessapp/gui/ProfilePanel.java:78-110`, `143-180`). It provides editable fields for targets across fitness, meals, and mindfulness, wiring changes back to in-memory storage for consistency (`src/wellnessapp/gui/ProfilePanel.java:188-220`). Logout is handled by disposing the current window and relaunching `LoginFrame` (`src/wellnessapp/gui/ProfilePanel.java:336-348`).

Main
`Main.java` is the entry point that initializes the UI on the Event Dispatch Thread using `SwingUtilities.invokeLater`, constructs a `LoginFrame`, and makes it visible (`src/wellnessapp/main/Main.java:12-21`). This keeps GUI setup thread-safe and delegates the session lifecycle to the login window, which hands off to `MainFrame` upon successful authentication.
